# LinkedIn Profile Viewers Viewer

Userscript that allows you to see who recently viewed your profile without buying premium - tested and used on [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), but should work with any userscript manager

Side note, if nothing shows up then try reloading the `/me/profile-views` page until it works lol

## ⚠️ NOTE: CURRENTLY BROKEN

As of a few months ago, it seems that LinkedIn no longer accidentally leaks info about blurred viewers in the profile view. There doesn't seem to be any other workaround I'm aware of :(
